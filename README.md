# 🚚📦 E-Commerce Product Delivery Prediction

This project focuses on predicting whether a product delivery will be **on time** or **delayed** based on various features of an e-commerce order.  
Using machine learning techniques, the goal is to help logistics and operations teams improve customer satisfaction and optimize delivery processes.

## 📁 Project Overview

- **Problem Statement:**  
  Predict if an e-commerce order will be delivered on time.
  
- **Dataset:**  
  The dataset includes features like `Product Type`, `Warehouse Location`, `Order Date`, `Shipping Mode`, `Delivery Time`, `Customer Rating`, and more.

- **Objective:**  
  Build a classification model to predict delivery status based on order attributes.
